Recent advancements in leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities have yielded remarkably promising results, exemplified by [DeepSeek-R1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12948), [Kimi k1.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12599), [OpenAI o3-mini](https://openai.com/index/o3-mini-system-card/), [Grok 3](https://x.ai/blog/grok-3). These exhilarating achievements herald ascendance of Large Reasoning Models, making us advance further along the thorny path towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Study of LLM reasoning has garnered significant attention within the community, and researchers have concurrently summarized [awesome RL-based LLM reasoning](https://github.com/bruno686/Awesome-RL-based-LLM-Reasoning). Meanwhile, we have observed that remarkably awesome work has already been done in the domain of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), encompassing both **multimodal understanding** and **autoregressive text-to-image generation**.
